# Virtual Environments lab

Run the following command in the terminal to list the number of installed packages: `pip list`.

We're now going to create a virtual environment, activate it, and load its contents:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

How many packages are installed now?
